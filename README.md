# Found it.
## Description

FoundIt is a website that helps you discover new project ideas for your next creative endeavor, whether it be a website, app, or other digital projects. Additionally, FoundIt is perfect for helping you to discover websites that you don't know the name/ link of.
## Instructions

1. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

4. [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

5. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

6. This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
